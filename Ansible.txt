Ansible:
++++===
1. Clinet only machine
2.Agent less
3.Python
4.Playbooks
5.Dafault port -22(ssh)

What Happens in Background:
+++++++++++++++++++++
1. Generate a python script
2. Copy the script to respesctive servers(10 servers code has to be copied)
3. Excute the script to respesctive servers
4. Wait for the script to complete execution on all hosts(servers)

Importanet To Note That:
+++++++++====
1.Ansible runs each task in parallel across all hosts
2.Anisble waits until all hosts have completed a task before moving to next node.
3.Ansible runs the task the order that you specify them.
4.To manage a server with ansible, the server needs to have ssh & pythin 2.5 or later installed 
 or python 2.4  with the python simple json library installed.
5. Ansible is an agent less configuration tool which works on ssh port (22)
6. Pushbased - Unlike chef and puppet are push based. its simply execute the playbook from parent/ansibel 
server to its clients.
7.Ansible scale down: Which means you can define a single host to "n" number of hosts for configuring.

*Idempotent
++++++++++++
Idempotent in simple; if its installed they wont do anything,if its not installed we need to install it.
if any chnages are made then it will revert back. Hence these type of behaviour clled Idempotent.

Ansible is written in yaml/yml

Playbook Syntax:
++++++++++++

---
- name: your playbook execution name
  hosts: your server on which you want to execute the code
  tasks:
   - name: task1
     module1:  your syntax
   - name: task2
     module2: your syntax

...

Installation Of Ansible:
++++++++++++++++++
3 servers
1. Contoller
2. Server1
3. Server2
adding local DNS

vim /etc/hosts

172.31.95.49   controller
172.31.80.20  server1
172.31.92.213  server2

Installing:
++++++++++++

Custom Configurations:
vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config
PasswodAuthenticaion: yes
cd /etc/ansible/
vim ansible.cfg

ssh-copy-id -i ec2-user@172.31.87.58(slave prvip)



Genaret the keys:
++++++++++++++++++
vim  mykey.pem
Your Pem.key - cpoy and past here

++++++++++++++++++++


vim ansible.cfg
[default]
inventory = ./myansibleservers
interpreter_python = /usr/bin/python
private_key_file = ./mykey.pem

[privilege_escalation]
become=True
become_methode=sudo
become_user=root

vim myansibleservers        #Groups
[dev]
server1
[prod]
serve2
[pre-prod]
server1
server2

Working With Ansible
+++++++++++++

---
- hosts: webserver
  become: true
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: install tomcat
    yum: name=tomcat state=present
  - name: start tomcat
